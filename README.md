# SmartKennel

SmartKennel is an internet connected device which provides pet owner's realtime updates from their dogâ€™s kennel. There are two elements to this project:
1. Kennel with connected sensors
2. Stuffed dog with LED display 
Both elements are connected via WiFi so that pet owners can get updates on their pet from wherever they are.
